You are validating success criteria for tasks.

We have tasks (in JSON):
{tasks}

For each item, output a JSON array with objects like:
{
  "prompt": "<original prompt text>",
  "decision": "keep" or "remove",
  "reason": "Why you decided"
}

Rules:
 - If success_criteria is too vague or missing (under 10 characters or meaningless text), remove it.
 - Otherwise, keep it.

Only return the JSON array.
