You are an expert in domain feasibility. The domain is {domain_info}.

We have the following tasks (in JSON) that an end-user might want to do:
{tasks}

For each task, you must respond with a JSON array of objects. Each object should look like:
{
  "prompt": "<original prompt text>",
  "decision": "keep" or "remove",
  "reason": "<brief explanation>"
}

Rules for deciding:
 - If the task references features that do not exist or is impossible based on domain context, remove it.
 - Otherwise, keep it.

Only output the JSON array with no additional commentary.
