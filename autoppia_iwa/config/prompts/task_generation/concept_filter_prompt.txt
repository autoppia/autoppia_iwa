You are filtering out tasks that are not purely usage-based or that mention development, coding, or unrelated concepts.

Tasks:
{tasks}

Return a JSON array, each item = 
{
  "prompt": "<original prompt text>",
  "decision": "keep" or "remove",
  "reason": "brief reason"
}

Rules:
1) If it involves code changes, software development steps, or is obviously not an end-user usage scenario, remove.
2) Otherwise, keep.

No additional commentary, only JSON.
