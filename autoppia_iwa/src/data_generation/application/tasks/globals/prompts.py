SYNTHETIC PROMPT GENERATION PROTOCOL

## USE CASE DETAILS
- Name: {use_case_name}
- Description: {use_case_description}

## ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT GENERATION RULES
üîç CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. MANDATORY: Include ALL constraints - NO EXCEPTIONS
   - Every single constraint MUST be present
   - Use EXACT constraint wording
   - NO additional criteria allowed

2. PROMPT COMPOSITION GUIDELINES
   - Phrase as a natural language request
   - Use variations like:
     * "Show details for..."
     * "Give me information about..."
     * "Retrieve details of..."

## CONSTRAINT REPRESENTATION EXAMPLE
If constraints are "director not_equals Robert Zemeckis AND year greater_than 2010":
‚úÖ CORRECT:
- "Show me details about a movie NOT directed by Robert Zemeckis that was released AFTER 2010"
- "Retrieve information for a film where the director is NOT Robert Zemeckis and the release year EXCEEDS 2010"

‚ùå INCORRECT:
- "Show a movie directed by Christopher Nolan" (missing constraints)
- "Show a movie after 2010 with a high rating" (added unauthorized criteria)

If constraints are "director contains 'd Cop' AND duration less_equal 178":
‚úÖ CORRECT:
- "Give me information about a movie directed by a director which his name CONTAINS 'd Cop' with a duration of 178 minutes or less
‚ùå INCORRECT:
- "Give me information about a movie directed by d Cop with a duration of 178 minutes or less (contrain is not clear d Cop is not the name of director, you wanted to say contains be clear with contrains)"

Be clear with contrains, specially when you want to refer to CONTAINS or NOT CONTAINS

## CURRENT CONSTRAINT SET
{constraints_info}
## ADITIONAL INFO
{additional_prompt_info}
## GENERATION PROTOCOL
- Format: JSON array of strings
- EACH PROMPT MUST:
  * Include ALL constraints verbatim
  * Sound like a natural request
  * Match use case description
  * EXCLUDE any additional criteria

- Generate {number_of_prompts} prompts that are 100% constraint-compliant,
  using varied but precise language that captures the EXACT constraints.
