    The design allows for multiple web agents to implement this interface, ensuring standardized inputs and behaviors across different agents.

    Every web agent that implements this interface must define the required methods and properties, ensuring consistency and compatibility.

    Example:
    - An 'Autopilot Web Agent' would implement this interface, adhering to the standardized inputs and outputs specified here.

    The goal is to provide a common structure that all web agents will follow, facilitating integration and interoperability among them.
