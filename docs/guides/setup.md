# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project locally on a Linux machine. It includes steps to
install Python 3.10 or above, set up a virtual environment or Conda environment, install Playwright, and configure the
project dependencies.

## **1. Introduction**

To ensure the proper functioning of the project, three essential components need to be running simultaneously:

1. **run_local_llm.py**: Local model server (used if you don't want to use the Runpod serverless model). Check the
   [Model Deployment Guide](../../modules/llm_local/setup.md): Step-by-step instructions for deploying the local model.

2. **webApp/app.py** OR **app.py**: Main project's endpoints that handle the core functionality of the project.

   - **webApp/app.py** _**(Not used now)**_: This file is used for managing socketio for _WebApp_.

   - **app.py**: Serves as the main flask entry point for the application. It initializes the application and handles
     API requests related to running benchmarks [Project Guide For Local Testing](setup.md) -> current file

3. **Demo (Django) app**: Runs the demo application for testing purposes (check its own **setup.md**)

> **Important:** Check the following steps and ports to starting all projects

### **1.1 Ports and Configurations**

The table below outlines the ports used by different applications in the project for easier configuration and reference.

| **Port** | **Application**                | **Description**                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `5000`   | Benchmark Flask App (`app.py`) | Default port for running the Flask development server.          |
| `8080`   | WebApp (`webApp/app.py`)       | Common port for running frontend (flask socketio) applications. |
| `8000`   | Django App (`manage.py`)       | Default port for running the Django development server.         |
| `6000`   | Local LLM Model Server         | Custom port for hosting the local LLM inference model.          |
| `27017`  | MongoDB                        | Default port for MongoDB database server.                       |
| `5432`   | PostgreSQL                     | Default port for PostgreSQL database server.                    |
| `3306`   | MySQL                          | Default port for MySQL database server.                         |

> **Note**: Update your configuration files and environment variables if custom ports are required. Ensure that these
> ports are open and accessible within your network.

This table provides the **model name**, a **link** to the model, and the **GPU memory requirements** for each model. Be
sure to have the appropriate hardware or cloud setup to meet these requirements when using the
models for inference or training.
Hereâ€™s an updated section for the setup guide with the new point added:

---

## **2. Project Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.10 or above**: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python's package manager.
- **Conda (Optional)**: If you prefer Conda for managing environments.
- **sudo/root privileges**: Required for installing system dependencies.
- **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or on a cloud cluster. You can update the MongoDB connection in the
  `.env` file by modifying the following line:

```dotenv
   MONGODB_URL="YOUR_MONGODB_URL"
```

- **Django App Database**: A database is required for the Django application. Follow the database setup instructions
  provided in the guide above to configure and connect your preferred database (check its own setup.md)

---

## INSTALLATION

## **Step 1: Verify Python Installation**

Check your Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If the version is earlier than 3.10, you'll need to install the correct version. On Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip
```

---

## **Step 2: Choose Environment Setup**

### Option 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment with `venv`

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   > **Note**:If you encounter issues with Python versions, ensure you are using Python 3.10 or higher. You can specify
   > the version when running commands:

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

---

### Option 2: Set Up a Conda Environment

1. Ensure Conda is installed. Check with:

   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```

   If Conda is not installed on your system, you can download and install it
   from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for a full-featured package
   or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for a lightweight version.

2. Create a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n autoppia python=3.11 -y
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate autoppia
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

1. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Playwright and its browser binaries:

   ```bash
   python3 -m playwright install
   ```

   This will download the necessary browser binaries for Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit).

---

## **Step 4: Set Up the Environment File (Only if You Don't Have One Already)**

1. **Create the `.env` File**:
   If you don't have a `.env` file in your project directory, create one by running:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Add the Required Environment Variables**:
   Copy and paste the following into your `.env` file only if the .env is not existing, customizing values where
   necessary.

   ```env
    # Can be "serverless", "local" and "openai"
    LLM_PROVIDER="local"

    # Local LLM Configuration
    #LOCAL_MODEL_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.0.103:6000/generate"
    LOCAL_MODEL_ENDPOINT="http://69.55.141.126:10278/generate"

    # OpenAI Configuration
    OPENAI_API_KEY=""
    OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4-32k-0613"
    OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS="2000"
    OPENAI_TEMPERATURE="0.7"

    # MongoDB Configuration
    MONGODB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   To ensure all environment variables are correctly set, use:
   ```bash
   cat .env
   ```
   Confirm that all necessary keys and paths are present.

---

## **Step 5: Test Browser User Profile Through Login**

This script tests browser automation with a persistent user profile. Here's what it does:

1. **Setup and Launch**: Loads the user profile directory from environment variables and launches a Chromium browser
   with the saved session data if any, otherwise it will created new profile.

2. **Authentication Check**:

   - If the user is logged in, it skips to event handling.
   - If not, it registers a new user or logs in if registration fails.

3. **Event Processing**: Retrieves events, saves them to the database, and optionally deletes them.

4. **Clean Up**: Closes the browser gracefully after all operations.

### **How to Run**:

1. Set up `.env` with `PROFILE_DIR` or use the default profile directory.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python3 tests/test_playwright_browser/ensure_chrome_profile.py
   ```

---

## **Step 6: Run Applications**

### Flask API Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

By default, Flask will run the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
You can interact with it using a browser, **Postman**, or **cURL**.

---

## **Step 7: Running All Tests**

This section outlines how to execute tests for various components, including task generation, action generation, and
task execution with evaluation.

---

### **Task Generation Tests**

To test task generation logic, run:

```bash
python3 tests/test_tasks_generator/test_generate_task_prompts.py
```

---

### **Action Generation Tests**

To test action generation functionality, execute:

```bash
python3 tests/test_actions_generation/test_actions_generation.py
```

---

### **Task Execution and Evaluation Tests**

#### **1. Single Task Execution**

To test the execution and evaluation of a single task, use:

```bash
python3 tests/task_execution_and_evaluation/test_generate_and_execute_actions.py
```

#### **2. Complete Task Generation and Execution**

> **Note**: This process may take some time and might not execute all tasks completely due to system or resource
> limitations.

To test the entire process of task generation followed by execution and evaluation, run:

```bash
python3 tests/test_tasks_generator/test_generate_tasks.py
```

---

### **Notes**

1. **Environment Activation**:

   - For `venv`: Activate the environment each time with `source venv/bin/activate`.
   - For Conda: Activate the environment with `conda activate autoppia`.

2. **Playwright Browsers**:
   Ensure the browsers are installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   python3 -m playwright install
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

3. **Dependencies**:
   If you add or update dependencies, make sure to update `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

Now your project should be ready to run! If you encounter issues, double-check the steps or refer to the project
documentation.
